<h1><font color="#000080">Magnum Opus error messages</font></h1>

<p>The 
following error messages may be generated by <b>Magnum Opus</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; During data 
import, where possible, <b>Magnum Opus </b>generates an error message, discards 
the current line from the input file, and continues.&nbsp; Errors for which this is 
possible are called <i>recoverable errors</i>.&nbsp; The remaining errors are called
<i>non-recoverable errors</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; On a non-recoverable error, the current action 
is aborted.</p>
<p>
Note that the identifier-item format allows little data checking.&nbsp; Any value in 
an appropriate column will be accepted as an identifier or item.&nbsp; The item-list<u>
</u>format allows no data checking.</p>
<p>All 
data import error messages specify the file and line on which the error was 
encountered.&nbsp; Where relevant, the column is also specified.&nbsp; For example, 
consider the following names file and data file.</p>
<p>
Names file &#8216;test.nam&#8217;:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 21.3pt">
<tt>a: a,b<br>
b: continuous<br>
c: 0,1</tt></p>
<p>
Data file &#8216;test.data:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 21.3pt">
<tt>a,1,0<br>
b,0 1</tt></p>
<p>The 
following error message will be generated, indicating the line and column on 
which the error has occurred (in this case, a missing comma).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 21.3pt">
<tt>Error on line 2 column 2 
of test.data: Missing or incorrect delimiter following value for attribute 'b'.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Encountered '1' when 
expecting ','.</tt></p>

<p><tt>WARNING: the (estimated) data set size exceeds the capacity of this computer's 
physical memory.<br>
Processing may be significantly slowed by use of virtual memory.</tt></p>
<blockquote><p>
<b>Magnum Opus</b> estimates that it will require more memory to process the current data set 
than the amount of physical memory installed in the host computer.&nbsp; If this 
estimate is correct then processing is likely to be significantly slowed by the 
use of virtual memory.&nbsp; This message is displayed to provide the user with the 
opportunity to reduce the data set size.&nbsp; This can be achieved by sampling.</p>
<p>
Where 
possible Magnum Opus augments this message with a suggested data sample 
percentage 
that will avoid this problem.&nbsp; Due to the difficulty of accurately estimating 
the amount of memory that will be required these estimates may prove inaccurate 
and should be taken as an approximate guide only.</p>

A line

column delimiter. &nbsp;One common cause of this is when the name of an attribute 
value includes the delimiter, for example, if a comma is part of a name.&nbsp; This 
can be resolved by either changing the delimiter or by putting quote marks (<tt>&quot;</tt>) 
around the name, for example <tt>&quot;clothing, outerwear&quot;</tt>.
